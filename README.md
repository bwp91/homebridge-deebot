### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your ECOVACS devices within HomeKit. The plugin:
  - requires your ECOVACS credentials to function
  - uses a cloud-based connection (i.e. requires the internet)
- This plugin is a much simplified version of [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs). If you are looking for more configurable options and different cleaning modes then [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs) will be more appropriate for you.

### Prerequisites

- To use this plugin, you will need to already have [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) (at least v1.4) or [HOOBS](https://hoobs.org) (at least v4.2) installed. Refer to the links for more information and installation instructions.
- Whilst it is recommended to use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16, the plugin supports v14 as per the [Homebridge guidelines](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/How-To-Update-Node.js).
