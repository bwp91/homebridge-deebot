### Plugin Information

* This plugin allows you to view and control your ECOVACS devices within HomeKit. The plugin:
  * requires your ECOVACS credentials to function
  * uses a cloud-based connection (i.e. requires the internet)
* This plugin is a much simplified version of [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs). If you are looking for more configurable options and different cleaning modes then [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs) will be more appropriate for you.

### Prerequisites
* To use this plugin, you will need to already have [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) (at least v1.3.3) or [HOOBS](https://hoobs.org) (at least v3.3.4) installed. Please refer to the links for more information and installation instructions.
