### Plugin Information


This package is a much simplified version of [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs). If you are looking for more configurable options and different cleaning modes then [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs) will be more appropriate for you.

This package will expose:
* A switch to turn auto cleaning mode on and off
* A switch to send your device back to the charging station
* A motion sensor to alert you if your device needs attention
* A battery service to alert you if your device's battery is low
* A humidity sensor service to show clearly the battery level % (humidity sensor is the best I can do :/)

This package has been tested with:
* The `N79` model (the device that I own)
* The `N79S` and `907`
