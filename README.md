### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your ECOVACS devices within HomeKit. The plugin:

  - uses a cloud-based connection (i.e. requires the internet)
- This plugin is a much simplified version of [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs). If you are looking for more configurable options and different cleaning modes then [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs) will be more appropriate for you.
